Problem 13.	C# and .NET Differences

C# is a language. but .NET is a framework. 
The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries. 
\C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment
that allows use of various high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms and architectures.
